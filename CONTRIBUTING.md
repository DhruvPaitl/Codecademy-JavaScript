What is this about?
These are notes are took from my JavaScript lesson and I am sharing them with you and making your life eaiser while learning JavaScript at Cocademy.
About the Units:
The units get harder as they go from 1, 2, 3, 4 and so one...So I would make sure to read and go through all of them so it would be easy for you when wou are about to code.
Each unit has a tital so you know what you are learning about and what is it teaching you.
Every unit has main projects sepreted from the learning projects you do, so you know what project is main and you should always do them after you have read and went through the whole unit.
Each unit has a lot of files which are to be opened RAW so you can open them on word.
When you open the word documents make sure to not copy and downlode my documents or try to edit or mess with them.
About the codes:
the codes were part of update 2.0 and were added so you can see how the final code of each important project looks like at the end.
About the Update:
The updates would not be very frequent, but are there so you check what is in this repostory and what is this going to look like in the future.
About the links:
They are there so you can go on the acctual website and learn about JavaScript too. (Codecademy link)
The JavaScript playground take you to a main.js which you can edit and test your codes in.
The MDN Web Docs will take you to their websites and teach you more about JavaScript functions.
About the Issues:
You can go check it out and see what isseus this thing has, you can also comment about any other mistakes I may I have made in this, and I would happily fix them for a better experience.
